A knight finds himself trapped in ancient ruins filled with monsters! To make things worse, vengeful spirits have placed a curse on him for disturbing their rest. Time is quickly running out! He needs to escape before the curse takes hold and he is overrun by the monsters or the curse claims him.

Time is your most important resource. It can be gained through defeating enemies, and used to purchase upgrades. As you progress through the game, time will be continually counting down, and can go into the negative. When time reaches 0, the game will become more difficult. If time reaches -3 minutes before you reach the end, the game is over. Reach the end of the dungeon before you run out of time.

Defeat all the enemies in a room to open the door and progress through the dungeon. Upgrades can be purchased by interacting with the shop, represented by a hourglass, to help you. Upon reaching the end, interact with the exit to escape.
