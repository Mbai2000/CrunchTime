Time is your most important resource. It can be gained through defeating enemies, and used to purchase upgrades. As you progress through the game, time will also be continually counting down, and can go into the negative. When time reaches 0, the game will become more difficult. If time reaches -3 minutes before you reach the end, the game is over. Reach the end of the dungeon before you run out of time.

Defeat all the enemies in a room to open the door and progress through the dungeon. Upgrades can be purchased by interacting with the shop, represented by a hourglass, to help you. Upon reaching the end, interact with the exit to escape.
